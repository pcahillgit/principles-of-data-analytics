# Principles of Data Analytics (Palmer Penguins Analysis)

## About this Notebook

This is my analysis of the [Palmer Penguins dataset](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/) as part of the assessment for the Principles of Data Analytics module.

This notebook demonstrates some key data analytics techniques:

- I outline how I import the Palmer Penguins dataset as well as various Python libraries that are used to explore the data.

- The notebook provides an overview of the types of data held within the dataset and includes some visualisations (a barchart and histogram) of two of those variables.

- I compare two variables form the Penguins dataset (flipper length and body mass), utilising a scatterplot and correlation coefficient to guage how correlated the two variables are.

## Get Started
I used [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) to create and write this [Jupyter Notebook](https://realpython.com/jupyter-notebook-introduction/) and recommend you download and use the same to view the work.

Anaconda will pre-install Python along with the libraries used within this notebook. Visual Studio Code is a tool which allows the user to view and edit code.
